  "plot": "\"Nanking\" tells the story of the rape of Nanking, one of the most tragic events in history. In 1937, the invading Japanese army murdered over 200,000 and raped tens of thousands of Chinese. In the midst of the horror, a small group of Western expatriates banded together to save 250,000 -- an act of extraordinary heroism. Bringing an event little-known outside of Asia to a global audience, \"Nanking\" shows the tremendous impact individuals can make on the course of history. It is a gripping account of light in the darkest of times.",
